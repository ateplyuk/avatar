# Progress

## What Works
- Step 1: Avatar generation
- Step 2: Background generation
- Step 3: Character positioning and scaling
- Task status tracking and polling
- Navigation between steps
- Error handling and display
- Response body display

## What's Left to Build
- Step 4: Final composition
- Additional error handling scenarios
- Loading states and animations
- User feedback improvements
- Testing and validation

## Current Status
- Backend API endpoints implemented for all steps
- Frontend components created for steps 1-3
- Basic error handling in place
- Navigation flow established
- Task status tracking working

## Known Issues
- Need to test overlay generation with various prompts
- Verify character positioning accuracy
- Ensure smooth scaling behavior
- Test error scenarios for overlay generation
- Validate navigation between steps
