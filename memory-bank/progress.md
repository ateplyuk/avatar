# Progress Tracking

## What Works
- Basic FastAPI application structure
- Router-based endpoint organization
- CORS middleware configuration
- Task status management system
- Avatar and background generation endpoints
- External service integration (fal-client)

## What's Left to Build
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Error handling improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Testing infrastructure
- Monitoring and logging enhancements
- Security improvements

## Current Status
- Core functionality implemented
- Basic documentation in place
- Memory Bank initialized
- System architecture documented

## Known Issues
1. In-memory storage limitations
   - No persistence across restarts
   - Potential memory constraints
   - No data backup mechanism

2. Documentation Gaps
   - API documentation needs completion
   - Integration guides needed
   - Performance benchmarks missing

3. Technical Debt
   - Error handling could be improved
   - Logging could be enhanced
   - Testing coverage needed
